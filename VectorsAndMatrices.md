All MATLAB variables are arrays. So,each numeric varialbe can contain multiple numbers. We can store related data in one variable by using an array.
Arrays are a basic programming tool in the MATLAB language, it's important to get to know them and the terminology used to describe them.

In MATLAB, a single number, called a scalar, is represented by a 1-by-1 array, meaning the array contains one row and one column.
